Hello, <br>     My name is Caleb Steffenhagen and I work for a Ministry called Dangerous Men United.  We are called Dangerous Men because we make men more dangerous for the kingdom of God by teaching them to fight against lust and pornography addiction. We also counsel them on issues of identity, accountability, forgiveness and spiritual warfare through our book called Dangerous Men. 
To support my role in developing and supporting leaders in the study I am raising financial support. One of efforts in support raising is candles, which I call Mandles, Dangerous Men Candles:) Candle making started as a hobby, and through a lot of trial and error I have gotten to a point where I can produce a quality product that one would find on the shelves of your local Target. Not only that, but I use the highest quality rated wax with additives that make my candles burn much longer than the average candle without sacrificing the quality of a pure scent that burns evenly thru the life of the candle. All of my Mandles fragrances are essential oil based providing quality fragrance second to none. 
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
